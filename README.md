# CouchRest Model Backend For Delayed Job

## Installation

Add the gems to your Gemfile:

    gem 'delayed_job'
    gem 'delayed_job_couchrest_model', :git => 'https://github.com/andreweskeclarke/delayed_job_couchrest_model.git'

That's it. Use [delayed_job as normal](http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job).

This is forked from
https://github.com/JamesHayton/delayed_job_couchrest_model, and probably
even further back from
https://github.com/raldred/delayed_job_couchrest_model

Going forward there will be a attempt to merge these changes into the
original authors' repos.
